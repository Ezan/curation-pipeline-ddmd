A marked section (stippled line) of the epifluorescence image is visualized withconfocal laser scanning microscopy where multiple z-stacks are rendered as a 3D-image (b). A section of this image is further magnified andrendered as a 3D-image with a different viewing angle (c). Coccoid bacteria are evident as green (live) and red (dead) cells
