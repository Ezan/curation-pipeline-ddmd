FIGURE 1 | Siderophore-mediated iron acquisition in staphylococci. (A) While S. aureus produces two different siderophores (staphyloferrin A, SA, and staphyloferrin B,SB), S. epidermidis synthesizes SA only, and S. lugdunensis hijacks SA and SB from these two staphylococci species instead of producing them. After being secretedinto the extracellular medium, SA and SB bind to extracellular iron (Fe) and make their way back to the cell as siderophore-iron complexes (SA-Fe and SB-Fe), providingthe iron levels required for several bacterial processes, including bioÔ¨Ålm formation. (B) In S. epidermidis, SA-mediated iron acquisition has recently been found tocontribute to bacterial survival in human macrophages, by withstanding the action of certain reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).
