Figure 4. Absence of histopathology in RP62A infected tibiae.The tibias described in Figure 3 were processed for demineralized histology andrepresentative micrographs of sections stained with Alcian blue hematoxylin/orange G (A-C), Brown and Brenn (D-F) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) (G-I) are shownat 25x (A-C) and 50x (D-I) (bar = 0.5mm). The implant insertion site is indicated by theasterix (*). Note the presence of normal bone marrow (BM) flanking the new bone thatformed around the implant in the RP62A infected tibia, in contrast to the S. aureus infectedtibia in which the marrow has been destroy and replaced by Staphylococcus abscesscommunities (#). The massive osteolysis and reactive bone formation (@) observed inUSA300 infected tibiae via micro-CT was confirmed by histology (C). Although no grosspathology (B) or Gram positive bacteria staining (E) was detected in RP62A infected tibia, alack of complete implant osseous integration was apparent from discontinuous boneformation around the implant (arrows in G vs. H), and fibrous tissue at the host-implantinterface (arrowheads in E & H).
