Figure 7. Limited osseous integration of transtibial implants into S. epidermidis infected tibiae.Mice (n=10) were challenged with a transtibial implant containing no bacteria (Sterile),1.6×105 CFU of RP62A, or 2.1×105 CFU of USA300, euthanized on day 14, and their tibiaewere harvested for biomechanical put out testing. The data for each tibia is presented withthe mean for the group ± SD (*p < 0.001 vs. Sterile; #p < 0.001 vs. RP62A). Of note is thatthere were significant differences between Sterile and RP62A, and RP62A and USA300.
