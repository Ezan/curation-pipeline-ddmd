Figure 3. Absence of osteolysis and reactive bone formation in RP62A infected tibiae.Mice (n=5) were challenged with a transtibial implant containing no bacteria (Sterile),1.6×105 CFU of RP62A, or 2.1×105 CFU of USA300, euthanized on day 14 post-op, andthe challenged tibiae were analyzed by micro-CT. (A) Representative 3D renderings of atibia from each group are shown to illustrate the remarkable osteolysis and reactive boneformation in USA300 infected tibiae, versus the osseous integrated Sterile implant. Of noteis that the RP62A infected tibiae were grossly indistinguishable from the Sterile implantgroup. (B) The lateral and medial hole area of the challenged tibiae were determined fromthe micro-CT scans, and the means ± SD are presented (*p<0.05 vs. Sterile; #p<0.05 vs.RP62A).
