Figure 6. Proinflammatory transcriptome in RP62A infected tibiae.Mice (n=4) were challenged with a transtibial implant containing no bacteria (Sterile),1.6×105 CFU of RP62A, or 2.1×105 CFU of USA300, euthanized on day 14, and their tibiaewere process for qPCR. Relative gene expression data are presented as the fold change fromSterile control with the mean ± SD (*p < 0.05 vs. Sterile, ♯p < 0.05 vs S.epidermidis). Ofnote is that there were no significant differences between S. epidermidis and S. aureus, andno differences between groups in most osteoblastic gene expression.
