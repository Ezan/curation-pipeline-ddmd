FIGURE 1 | (A) Model of S. aureus bioﬁlm growth cycle. In summary, uponcoming into contact with a surface, planktonic cells attach throughsurface-associated proteins. Following attachment, cells divide and beginproduction of the extracellular matrix, which leads to the formation of amicrocolony. As cell division continues, biomass accumulates and a maturebioﬁlm is formed. Environmental signals within the bioﬁlm trigger theactivation of dispersal mechanisms, and upon dispersal, cells re-enter aplanktonic growth state and can seed new sites for bioﬁlm formation. (B)Treatment of a S. aureus bioﬁlm. Antibiotic exposure will kill susceptibleplanktonic cells and metabolically active cells near the surface of thebioﬁlm. However, persister cells and metabolically dormant cells within thebioﬁlm survive and remain protected from immune defenses by the bioﬁlmmatrix. Treatment with dispersal agents increases the effectiveness ofantibiotic penetration and promotes clearance. Antibiotic sensitive cellswithin the bioﬁlm are exposed and killed after degradation of the matrix,and the antibiotic tolerant cells (such as persisters) survive and aresusceptible to the immune system.
