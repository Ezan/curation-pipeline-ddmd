FIGURE 3. Results of scanning electron microscopy analysis. (A) After a 1 hour incubation, bacterial cells of bioﬁlm-positive staphylococcal clinicalstrain appeared to accumulate as small monolayer sheets (20003). Thread-like appendages (arrow) were found around the bacterial cells, andprojected from the bacterial cell wall toward the cover slip surface (70003). (B) For the bioﬁlm-positive staphylococcal clinical strain, after a 6 hourincubation, the previously small monolayer sheets developed into larger multilayer sheets (20003), and the bacterial cells became encased in anmucoid material (arrow) (70003). (C) For the bioﬁlm-positive staphylococcal clinical strain, after a 24 hour incubation, the 3D bioﬁlm structure wasformed (20003), and bacterial clusters appeared to be coated on all sides with a gelatinous material (70003). (D) For the bioﬁlm-positive
