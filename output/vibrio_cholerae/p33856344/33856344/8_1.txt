figure supplement 1). In the DnspS mutant, c-di-GMP levels were lower than in the WT as judgedby the c-di-GMP reporter (Figure 3F), showingthat MbaA is locked as a constitutive phosphodi-esterase. Exogenous addition of polyamines hadno effect on c-di-GMP levels (Figure 3F).Together, these findings demonstrate that theWT V. cholerae response to polyamines is con-trolled by the NspS-MbaA polyamine sensingcircuit.
