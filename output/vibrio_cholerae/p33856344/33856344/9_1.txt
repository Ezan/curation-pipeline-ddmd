Figure 4. Both the MbaA SGDEF and EVL domains are required for regulation of V. cholerae biofilm dispersal. (A) Quantitation of biofilm biomass overtime for the V. cholerae strains carrying mbaA-3xFLAG, mbaAEVL*À3xFLAG, and mbaASGDEF*À3xFLAG. (B) Quantitation of biofilm biomass over timemeasured by time-lapse microscopy for V. cholerae carrying mbaAEVL*À3xFLAG following addition of water (Ctrl), 100 mM norspermidine, or 100 mMspermidine. (C) c-di-GMP reporter output at the indicated polyamine concentrations for V. cholerae carrying mbaAEVL*À3xFLAG. Relative reportersignal (% difference) is displayed as a heatmap (teal and purple represent the lowest and highest reporter output, respectively). (D) As in (B) for thembaASGDEF*À3xFLAG mutant. (E) As in (C) for the mbaASGDEF*À3xFLAG mutant. (F) Schematic representing the proposed MbaA activities in responseto norspermidine and spermidine. Biofilm biomass data are represented as means normalized to the peak biofilm biomass of the WT strain or Ctrlcondition. In all cases, N = 3 biological and N = 3 technical replicates, ± SD (shaded). a.u.: arbitrary unit. In the c-di-GMP reporter assays, values areexpressed as the percentage difference relative to the untreated WT strain, allowing comparisons to be made across all heatmaps in all figures in thisarticle. The same color bar applies to all panels in this article. For each condition, N = 3 biological replicates. Numerical values and associated SDs areavailable in Supplementary file 1. OM: outer membrane; IM: inner membrane.The online version of this article includes the following figure supplement(s) for figure 4:
