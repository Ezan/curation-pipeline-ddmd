Figure 6. MbaA and intracellular polyamine levels remain constant throughout the biofilm lifecycle. (A) Top panel: western blot showing MbaA-3xFLAGlevels at 5 hr and 10 hr post inoculation. Bottom panel: the RpoA loading control. Data are representative of three biological replicates. (B)Measurements of intracellular (left panel) and extracellular (right panel) norspermidine (Nspd) and spermidine (Spd) levels at 5 hr and 10 hr postinoculation. Intracellular levels were normalized to wet cell pellet mass. N = 3 biological replicates, error bars represent SDs, and unpaired t-tests wereperformed for statistical analysis. n.s.: not significant; ***p<0.001.The online version of this article includes the following figure supplement(s) for figure 6:
