Figure 1. Polyamine sensing in V. cholerae. Schematic showing the previously proposed polyamine detection and import mechanisms in V. cholerae.Norspermidine (Nspd, triangles) promotes biofilm formation and spermidine (Spd, circles) represses biofilm formation. The primarily eukaryoticpolyamine spermine (not pictured) also signals through the NspS-MbaA pathway. See text for details. OM: outer membrane; IM: inner membrane.
