Figure 3. Periplasmic detection of polyamines controls V. cholerae biofilm dispersal. (A) Quantitation of biofilm biomass over time measured by time-lapse microscopy following addition of water (Ctrl), 100 mM norspermidine, or 100 mM spermidine to WT V. cholerae. (B) Light output from the PvpsL-lux reporter for the treatments in (A) over the growth curve. (C) c-di-GMP reporter output at the indicated polyamine concentrations for WT V. cholerae.Relative reporter signal (% difference) is displayed as a heatmap (teal and purple represent the lowest and highest reporter output, respectively). (D) Asin (A) for the DmbaA mutant. (E) As in (C) for the DmbaA mutant. (F) As in (C) for the DnspS mutant. Biofilm biomass data are represented as meansnormalized to the peak biofilm biomass of the Ctrl condition. In all biofilm biomass measurements, N = 3 biological and N = 3 technical replicates, ±SD (shaded). a.u.: arbitrary unit. In vpsL-lux measurements, N = 3 biological replicates, ± SD (shaded). RLU: relative light units. For the c-di-GMPreporter assays, values are expressed as the percentage difference relative to the untreated WT strain, allowing comparisons to be made across allheatmaps in all figures in this article. The same color bar applies to all heatmaps in this article. For each condition, N = 3 biological replicates.Numerical values and associated SDs are available in Supplementary file 1.The online version of this article includes the following figure supplement(s) for figure 3:
