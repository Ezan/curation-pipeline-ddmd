Fig. 1. Single-cell imaging of a growing V. cholerae biofilm cluster. Cross-sectional images of the bottom cell layer at 1 h (A), 7 h (B), 12 h (C), and 18 h(D). (Scale bars: 3 μm.) (E) Segmenting the 3D biofilm cluster in D into 7,199 cells, color-coded according to z position (0–21 μm). (F) Spatial distribution of the zand radial components of each cell’s orientation director ez and er, volume fraction ϕ, and alignment order parameter ζ for the 18-h cluster in E. (G) Timeevolution of cell number, averaged ez, biovolume per cell Vcell, cluster radius R (red circles), and height H (blue squares). In the ez plot, average values fromcells with x–y coordinates that are less and more than R/2 away from the center are shown as red plus signs and blue plus crosses, respectively. We identifiedthree phases, denoted by the vertical dashed lines. Phase II is characterized by a steady decrease of Vcell (red arrow), an increase in hezi, and faster growth of Hthan R. (Inset) Ratio between growth rates of the cluster height H_ and radius R_ in phases I and II averaged over five samples (error bars correspond to SDs); thered line corresponds to a ratio of 1.
