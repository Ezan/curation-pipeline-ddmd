Fig. 2. Cell reorientation and ordering require surface adhesion. (A) Side view of a growing biofilm cluster of V. cholerae at the indicated times. Red arrowsindicate the reoriented cells, as well as their daughter cells. (B) Growing V. cholerae cluster (Top) with Bap1 labeled with Cy3 antibody (Bottom) at 6 and 30 h.Arrows indicate the position of the founder cell. (C and D) Top and side views of a simulated biofilm without (C) and with (D) cell-to-surface attachment. (E)Representative biofilm cluster from Δbap1ΔrbmC cells at 18 h at the bottom layer (Top) and 5 μm above the surface (Bottom). (F) Plots of ez, er, ϕ, and ζ forthe image shown in E. (G) Local order parameter ζ(ϕ) versus ϕ for the Rg parent strain (blue circles) and Δbap1ΔrbmC (ΔBC, red squares). (H) Restoration ofcell-to-surface attachment in Δbap1ΔrbmC biofilms by cell-free conditioned medium lacking the indicated component(s). B denotes Bap1, and C denotesRbmC. Surface attachment is quantified by the fraction of biomass remaining after being subjected to flow (Fleft), averaged over four biological replicates(error bars correspond to SDs). (Scale bars: A, B, and E, 5 μm.)
