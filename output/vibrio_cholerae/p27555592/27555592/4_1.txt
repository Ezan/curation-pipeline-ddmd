Fig. 3. Deletion of RbmA causes biofilm expansion driven by matrix production. (A) Cross-sectional image of the bottom layer of a biofilm cluster of ΔrbmAcells at 18 h. (B) Corresponding spatial distribution of ez and ϕ. (C) Side view of formation of the ΔrbmA biofilm cluster at indicated times. (D) Time evolutionof cell number, hezi, Vcell, R, and H for the ΔrbmA biofilm cluster shown in C and D. Color and symbol designations follow Fig. 1. Vcell shows an additionalphase in which Vcell increases sharply (red arrow), characterizing the expansion mode driven by the matrix. (E) Fraction of cells remaining following me-chanical perturbation (Fleft) for the Rg parent biofilm (□) and the ΔrbmA biofilm (○) averaged over four biological replicates (error bars correspond to SDs).For ΔrbmA biofilms, we characterize Fleft for the bottom 75% (red) and top 25% (blue) biofilm biomasses, respectively. (F) Final fraction of the ΔrbmA mutantremaining (fΔrbmA) starting from a 1:1 mixture of the Rg parent strain and the ΔrbmA mutant at the surface with low surface coverage (○) and high surfacecoverage (■). (G) Representative contact configuration between an Rg biofilm cluster (yellow) and a ΔrbmA mutant cluster (red), shown with two channelscombined (Left) and separated (Center and Right). (Scale bars: A, C, and G, 10 μm.)
