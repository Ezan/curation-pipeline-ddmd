Fig. 4. Schematic representation of the V. cholerae biofilm formation pro-cess. Yellow cylinders represent the rod-shaped bacterial cells. Blue repre-sents the RbmC/Bap1 matrix proteins that adhere the cells to the surface.Magenta denotes the RbmA protein. The pale peach background representsthe Vps matrix, and its transparency in the different panels correspondsto the amount of Vps present in the biofilm. The brown contour at the rimof the biofilms represents the envelope formed by Vps/RbmC/Bap1. Bluearrows denote the spontaneously generated, surface-associated compres-sion that is responsible for cell reorientation and ordering.
