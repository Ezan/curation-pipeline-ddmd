Fig. 4. Reorientations in swimming direction are required for V. choleraebiofilm dispersal. (A) Representative 16 h images and quantitation of biofilmbiomass over time measured by time-lapse microscopy for WT V. cholerae,the ΔcheY3 mutant, and the cheY3D16K,Y109W (cheY3*) mutant. (B) Thecorresponding PvpsL-lux output for WT and the ΔcheY3 strain over thegrowth curve. (C) Representative, randomly colored, single-cell locomotiontrajectories for the strains in A. (D) Turning frequencies of the strains in A.(E) Measured swimming velocities of the strains in A. (F) Proposed model forthe role of motility and reorientation in biofilm dispersal. (G) Quantitationof biofilm biomass over time for WT and the ΔcheY3 mutant followingtreatment with DMSO or the motility inhibitor phenamil supplied at 5 hpostinoculation. For biofilm biomass assays, n = 3 biological replicates andn = 3 technical replicates, ± SD (shaded). For vpsL-lux measurements, n = 3biological replicates, ± SD (shaded). For motility measurements, 45 to 125individual cells of each strain were tracked. In D and E, unpaired t tests wereperformed for statistical analysis. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001;****P < 0.0001; n.s., P > 0.05.
