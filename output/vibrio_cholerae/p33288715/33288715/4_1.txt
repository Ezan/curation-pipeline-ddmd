Fig. 2. A two-component system composed of DbfS (HK) and DbfR (RR) controls V. cholerae biofilm dispersal. (A) Representative images at 16 h andquantitation of biofilm biomass over time measured by time-lapse microscopy for WT V. cholerae and the ΔdbfS (i.e., Δvc1639) mutant. (B) The correspondingPvpsL-lux output for strains and growth conditions in A over the growth curve. (C, Top) Operon structure of the genes encoding the DbfS-DbfR two-componentsystem. (C, Bottom) Cartoon of the domain organization of DbfS. (D) As in A for the ΔdbfR (i.e., Δvc1638) strain and for the ΔdbfS ΔdbfR double mutant. (E)As in A for the dbfRD51V and ΔdbfS dbfRD51V strains. (F) Representative Phos-tag gel analysis of DbfR-SNAP in the absence (−Ara) or presence (+Ara) of DbfS.Fucose was added to repress DbfS production in the uninduced samples. A phosphorylated protein migrates slower than the same unphosphorylated protein.(G) Proposed model for the DbfS-DbfR phosphorylation cascade regulating biofilm dispersal. OM, outer membrane; IM, inner membrane. In all biofilmmeasurements, n = 3 biological replicates and n = 3 technical replicates, ± SD (shaded). For vpsL-lux measurements, n = 3 biological replicates, ± SD (shaded).The Phos-tag gel result is representative of n = 3 independent biological replicates.
