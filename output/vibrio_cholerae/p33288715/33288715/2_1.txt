Fig. 1. A high-content imaging screen identified genes required for V. cholerae biofilm dispersal. (A) Schematic illustrating the V. cholerae biofilm lifecycle.See text for details. (B) Brightfield image series over time of the WT V. cholerae biofilm lifecycle. (C, Top) Quantitation of biofilm biomass over time asmeasured by time-lapse microscopy for WT and representative transposon insertion mutants from each of the three functional categories identified in thescreen. Note the differences in y-axis scales. Data are represented as means normalized to the peak biofilm biomass of the WT strain. n = 3 biologicalreplicates and n = 3 technical replicates, Â± SD (shaded). a.u., arbitrary unit. (C, Bottom) Representative brightfield images of biofilms at the final 16 htimepoint for the strains presented in C, Top.
