Fig. 3. Matrix-digesting enzymes mediate V. cholerae biofilm dispersal. (A) Representative 16 h images and quantitation of biofilm biomass over timemeasured by time-lapse microscopy for WT V. cholerae and the ΔlapG mutant. (B) The corresponding PvpsL-lux output for strains and growth conditions in Aover the growth curve. (C) Schematic representing the LapG mechanism. (D) As in A for the WT, the ΔlapD single mutant, and the ΔlapD ΔlapG doublemutant. (E) As in A for the WT and the ΔrbmB mutant. (F) As in B for the WT and the ΔrbmB mutant. (G) Representative images and quantitation of WGA-txRed signal in ΔlapG and ΔrbmB biofilms at 16 h postinoculation. To account for differences in biomass, the WGA-txRed signal was divided by the DAPI signalin each biofilm. Values were normalized to the mean signal for the ΔlapG strain. More than 100 individual biofilms were quantified for each strain. Anunpaired t test was performed for statistical analysis. ****P < 0.0001. (H) Proposed model for the role of RbmB in biofilm dispersal. Gray lines represent thepolysaccharide matrix. (I) As in A for the WT and the ΔlapG ΔrbmB double mutant. In all cases, n = 3 biological replicates and n = 3 technical replicates, ± SD(shaded). For vpsL-lux measurements, n = 3 biological replicates, ± SD (shaded).
