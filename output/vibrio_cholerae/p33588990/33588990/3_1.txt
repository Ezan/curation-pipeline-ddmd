Figure 1. Development of Vibrio cholerae co969 colony rugosity is temperature- and HapR-dependent. (A) Representative images of different V.cholerae co969 colony rugosities at 37˚C: S (smooth), M (transition between smooth and rugose), R (rugose), and RR (very rugose). (B) Representative V.cholerae co969 colony morphologies at 37˚C and 22˚C, after incubation during 14 and 24 hr, respectively. (C) Development of V. cholerae co969 colonyrugosity over time at different temperatures. Rugosity is represented as contrast calculated using ImageJ software (see Materials and methods section).Colonies grown at 22˚C remained smooth despite the incubation time. (D) Colony-forming units (CFUs) of collected colonies grown at differenttemperatures and different rugosity stages: S (smooth), M (transition between smooth and rugose), R (rugose), and RR (very rugose). Values are theaverage of at least three independent experiments with at least three biological replicates each. Error bars, standard deviation. For 22˚C, values arefrom smooth colonies after 48 hr incubation. (E) Colony morphology at 37˚C and 22˚C of co969, co969:hapRc (co969 strain carrying the active variant ofhapR from C6706, hapRc), and C6706 and A1552 and their respective DhapR-mutant derivatives. The incubation times at different temperatures werepreviously optimized to result in colonies with a comparable number of CFU per colony.
