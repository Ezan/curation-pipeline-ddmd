Figure 3. Transposon mutagenesis identifies VC2744 as a regulator of Vibrio cholerae colony morphology at 22˚C. (A) Representative image of an agarplate used for the selection of V. cholerae co969 transposon mutants with a rugose colony phenotype (pointed with red arrows) at 22˚C. The number ofscreened transposon mutants, rugose colonies selected, and final number of genes with insertions leading to truncations is indicated below. (B) Tableof transposon screen hits sorted by functional annotation. (C and D). Effect of VC2744 on co969 colony morphology. (C) Deletion of VC2744 in co969results in a rugose colony phenotype at 22˚C. (D) Colony morphology at 37˚C and 22˚C of co969 and co969 DVC2744 carrying either pHL100-bipA, foroverexpression of V. cholerae co969 VC2744 from the isopropyl-b-d-thiogalactosidase-inducible Plac promoter, pHL100-ECbipA; or pHL100-PPbipA, foroverexpression of the bipA variants of Escherichia coli MG1655 K-12 or Pseudomonas putida KT2440, respectively, or the empty plasmid (pHL100).Overexpression of the different BipA variants restored the smooth colony phenotype at 22˚C, while it only resulted in slightly decreased rugosity at 37˚C.
