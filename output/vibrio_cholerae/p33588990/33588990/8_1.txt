Figure 4. BipA protein levels are elevated at 22˚C. (A) Relative bipA transcript levels in Vibrio cholerae co969:bipA-flag or co969:hapRc:bipA-flagstrains, carrying a chromosomal bipA-flag fusion, between rugose colonies grown at 37˚C (37R) and smooth colonies grown at 22˚C (22 Sb), determinedby quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Data are the average of three biological replicates, each containing eight colonies pooledtogether. Error bars, standard deviation. (B) Representative Western blot showing BipA-flag (68.18 KDa) protein levels of co969:bipA-flag or co969:hapRc:bipA-flag rugose colonies grown at 37˚C (37R) and smooth colonies grown at 22˚C (22 Sb). BipA-flag bands migrated close to the 72 KDa bandof the protein ladder. co969 and co969:hapRc strains were used as negative controls. The Coomassie staining of the membrane, used as a loadingcontrol, is shown.
