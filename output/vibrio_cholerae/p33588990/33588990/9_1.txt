Figure 5. Ribosome assembly analyses in the wild-type and the bipA mutant. (A) Representative traces of sucrose gradient sedimentation experiments,involving cells grown at 37˚C or 22˚C, as indicated. Absorbance at 254 nm (A254) is shown from the top to the bottom of the gradient (left to right), andpeaks corresponding to 30S, 50S, 70S, and polysomes (multiple ribosomes per mRNA) are indicated. (B) Levels of 30S particles (30S), 50S particles (50S),and polysomes (Polys), normalized with respect to 70S monosomes (70S), from various cells as indicated.
