Figure 7. Proposed model for BipA within the Vibrio cholerae biofilm regulatory cascade. Schematic showing theproposed model for the interplay between the main biofilm transcriptional regulators, VpsR, VpsT, and HapR, andthe translational repressor, BipA. In HapRÀ strains, transcription of vpsR and vpsT and the biofilm genes (vpsI andvpsII clusters encoding the Vibrio polysaccharide [VPS], and rbmA, rmbC, and bap1 encoding the matrix proteins)leads to biofilm formation at 37˚C but not at 22˚C, where high levels of BipA inhibit translation of the mRNAs ofthe biofilm activators and/or structural genes. In HapR+ strains, transcription of both the biofilm activators and thebiofilm genes is negatively regulated by HapR, and no biofilm is produced (i.e. a smooth colony forms). At 22˚C,BipA constitutes an additional layer of control by ensuring that, even if residual levels of biofilm-associatedtranscripts are produced, their translation would be inhibited.
