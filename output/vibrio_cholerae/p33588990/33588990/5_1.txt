Figure 2. Biofilm structural components, but not regulators, are transcriptionally upregulated in rugose colonies grown at higher temperatures.Comparison of relative gene expression between Vibrio cholerae co969 colonies incubated at 37˚C (rugose, 37R) and 22˚C (smooth, 22 Sb) by mRNA-seq. Colonies had a similar number of colony-forming units per colony, as described under experimental procedures. (A) Relative expression of vpsLand bap1 between colonies grown at 37˚C vs. 22˚C for co969 and co969:hapRc strains, determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactionFigure 2 continued on next page
