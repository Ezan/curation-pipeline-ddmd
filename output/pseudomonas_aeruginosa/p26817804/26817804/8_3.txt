Figure 6. Norspermidne restrains theexpression of QS-r­elated genes andproduction of virulence factors. (A) PAO1 was Ccultured and treated with 0 or 4 mmol/Lnorspermidine and qRT-P­ CR analysis wasperformed as described in the Materials andMethods section. Activities of virulencefactors including (B) protease activity, (C)pyocyanin, and (D) elastase activity atdifferent concentrations of norspermidine(0, 2, and 4 mmol/L) were analyzed.*P < 0.05versus untreated control, and error barsindicate SD.
