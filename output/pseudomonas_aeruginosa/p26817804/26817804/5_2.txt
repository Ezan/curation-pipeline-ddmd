Figure 2. The effect of norspermidineagainst PAO1 biofilm. (A) Biofilm formation.Overnight culture was treated with0–5 mmol/L norspermidine for 24 h. Thevolume of biofilm was determined by crystalviolet assay. Error bars represent SD. (B)Biofilm eradication. Twenty-f­our hourmature biofilms were cultured overnightwith norspermidine at concentrationsranging from 0 to 6 mmol/L and thequantification of biofilm formationdetermined by crystal violet assay. *P < 0.05versus untreated control. Error bars representSD. (C) Representative images(magnification, 10 × 100) of PAO1 biofilmtreated with norspermidine, and the effectsof norspermidine were assessed by crystalviolet staining.
