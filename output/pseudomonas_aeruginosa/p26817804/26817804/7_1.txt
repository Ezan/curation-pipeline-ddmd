Figure 3. SEM examination for eradication ofPAO1 mature biofilm by norspermidine. The24 h mature biofilms on (A) catheter andcover slide were cultured with (4 mmol/L) orwithout norspermidine for another 24 h,then fixed and examined by SEM. (B)Norspermidine reduced the biofilm biomassand changed its morphology.
