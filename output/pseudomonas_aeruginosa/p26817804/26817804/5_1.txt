Figure 1. PAO1 planktonic cell growth with norspermidine. (A) Kinetic planktonic cell growth (optical density). Cells grown overnight were treatedwith 0, 4, 5, 6, and 7 mmol/L norspermidine, and every 2 h cells were carefully transferred to another microtiter plate for total 18 h, and OD630 nmwas read. (B) Planktonic cell growth (CFU). PAO1 cells grown overnight were treated with 0, 4, 5, 6, and 8 mmol/L norspermidine, and every 2 h cellswere diluted and spiral plated on blood agar plates. Error bars represent SD.
