Fig. 1. Comparing bacterial growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and OprF mutant strain on LB Broth. It is demonstrated that generation time of the OprF deÔ¨Åcient strain was slowerand the elongated lag time of inoculation, than the P. aeruginosa wild strain, however, decline phase showed similar pattern for both strains.
