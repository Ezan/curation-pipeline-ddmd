Fig. 5. OprF mutant strains showing altered pyocyanin production. Compared tothe relative amounts of pyocyanin extracted from strain P. aeruginosa PAO1 afterthe bacteria were grown in LB broth. Experiments were repeated three times andpyocyanin measurements at OD520 was obtained using microplate reader andnormalized to cell growth measured as OD600.
